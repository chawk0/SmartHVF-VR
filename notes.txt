test info:

	eye to test

	color settings, test type  (24-2, etc)

	stimulus algorithm settings (delay, initial step size, reversals, etc)

	patient associated to the test

	stimulus field values

	method to generate eyemap?

	

patient data:

	name, age

	list of tests

	threshold info?



move all relevant test objects/data into the TestInfo class

figure out how to serialize and save all of that to storage

do the same with the patient class

expand the patient GUI panels

load up one testinfo/patient at a time in Main and run through test
